# Note: Most of these HistoryChange types were built based on looking through UI code in Luma, because we don't have existing API
#       support for the Negotiable Quote history log feature. If we find these types aren't ideal during implementation,
#       let's iterate rather than stay glued to them.

#       Diffing class: https://github.com/magento/magento2b2b/blob/5547298c3dde48234ce74ed8ae9000fce3fe01b1/app/code/Magento/NegotiableQuote/Model/History/DiffProcessor.php
#       Block for UI:  https://github.com/magento/magento2b2b/blob/0e791b5f7cd604ee6ee40b7225807c01b7f70cf2/app/code/Magento/NegotiableQuote/Block/Quote/History.php

#
#       There is currently no support for the `Custom Log` feature supported by the Luma UI, but we can add it on
#       https://github.com/magento/magento2b2b/blob/0e791b5f7cd604ee6ee40b7225807c01b7f70cf2/app/code/Magento/NegotiableQuote/view/base/templates/quote/history.phtml#L316-L363
#
# Implementation Notes:
#       - Fields in NegotiableQuoteHistoryChanges should be null when no change is present
#       - An Object Type is used, rather than a list, because the UI likely wants
#         to render some of these differently from others in the UI, and a List would require us to guess
#         at the desired ordering for the client. This is also more extensible with less risk of breaking
#         changes (compared to extending a union or shared interface)
