# GraphQL Wishlist Functionality

## Open Source edition
### Get customer wishlist id
In order to get customer wishlist data need to call `customer` query.
``` graphql
query {
  customer {
    wishlist {
      id
      items {
        id
        product {
          sku
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If wishlist for customer does not exist, empty one will be created under the hood i.e. we assume that empty wishlist always exists for customer.

### Add product(s) to wishlist
Use `addProductsToWishlist` mutation in order to add products to wishlist with or without options. Need to specify `wishlist_id` and the `wishlist_items`.

### Update product(s) in wishlist
Use `updateProductsInWishlist` mutation in order to update products in wishlist with or without options. Need to specify `wishlist_id` and the `wishlist_items`.

### Remove product(s) from wishlist
Use `updateProductsInWishlist` mutation in order to remove products from wishlist by ID. Need to specify `wishlist_id` and the array of `wishlist_items_ids`.

### Remove wishlist
Use `removeWishlist` mutation in order to remove wishlist by `id`.

## Commerce edition
Use `createWishlist(name: String!):` in order to create named wishlist.

### Get multiple customer wishlists
``` graphql
query {
  customer {
    wishlists {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```
`customer` query will return array of all available customer wishlists.

### Get customer wishlist items by `id`
``` graphql
query {
  customer {
    wishlist(id: '42') {
      items {
        id
        product {
          sku
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Solutions comparison

|  | Proposed | Alternative 1 | Alternative 2 |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------| -------------|
| Open Source  | `wishlist` | `wishlists` | `wishlists`|
| Commerce  | `wishlists` and `wishlist(id: ID!)` | `wishlists(ids: [ID])` | `wishlists`|

### Proposed
`wishlist` field located under `Customer` type. Commerce edition will introduce new field `wishlists` to get an array of customer wishlists. `wishlist` field will be extended with `id` argument in order to able to retrieve info for single wishlist by ID.
#### Pros
- Semantically correct - in Open Source one wishlist will be returned, in Commerce - array of wishlist.
- It is possible to get info for the single wishlist by `ID` in Commerce edition.
#### Cons
- Client code has to be different for Open Source and Commerce editions. Missing `id` in Commerce will cause an error.
It is not a big problem because client has to know about Wishlist Name in Commerce edition anyway and has to adjust respectively.

### Alternative 1
`wishlists` field located under `Customer` type. In Commerce edition will be extended with `ids` argument in order to not to over-fetch and be able to retrieve info only for needed wishlists.

#### Pros
- Solves over-fetching problem.
- Client could work with both - Open Source and Commerce editions without changing the code.
#### Cons
- In Open Source edition array with one element will be returned instead of single item.
- Need to call `wishlists` at least once to get available wishlists `ids`.

### Alternative 2
`wishlists` field located under `Customer` type. In Open Source will be array with one element, in Commerce - multiple elements.
#### Proc
- Client could work with both - Open Source and Commerce editions without changing the code.
#### Cons
- In Commerce edition all wishlists will be returned, not just needed (over-fetching).
- In Open Source edition array with one element will be returned instead of single item.

## Manipulation with IDs

In order to perform operations with wishlist and wishlist items ID is required, because there is no other unique identifier:
 - wishlist `name` is available only for Commerce Edition
 - product `sku` in `WishlistItem` can be duplicated with different set of options

Since UUID for entities is not implemented yet, it is proposed to use casted to string `entity_id` for now in order to use `ID` type.
Need to make BC change to WishlistItem.
``` graphql
type WishlistItem {
    id: ID #was Int
}
```
This value was previously used for display only, other operations like update or delete are not implemented yet.

## Exposure through product interface

When rendering a product you need to know which wishlists a particular product is assigned to. This is in a way just like categories.

Example:
``` graphql
type ProductInterface {
    wishlists: [WishlistReference]! @doc(description: "A product can be assigned to multiple wishlist of none")
}
type WishlistReference {
   wishlist_uid: ID!
   name: String
}
```

By default a product is not assigned to any wishlist

### Considerations of performance optimizations and usages
The UI really needs this to render a PDP page or Category with products page and list a dropdown of wishlists of which the product is assigned to.
It won't need all the data in wishlist for this purpose. However, it would need all the wish lists available and only check the ones that the product belongs to.

The question is: Do we reference the Wishlist and create a minimal type based on what the UI would need or do we just output the whole Wishlist as a true graph would do?

Example:
``` graphql
type ProductInterface {
    wishlists: [Wishlist]! @doc(description: "A product can be assigned to multiple wishlist or now wishlist")
}
```

By only going with a small subset of the Wishlist type (`WishlistRerefence`) can improve performance by "cutting the graph" and returning something fit for UI needs rather than loop through all the wishlist.
