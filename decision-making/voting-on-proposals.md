# Voting on Proposals
The Architecture team handles the proposal workflow and is responsible for procedural compliance.

## Proposal submission
- A proposal is submitted by opening a pull request to this repository.
- The initiator must present the idea in an architecture meeting.
- The announcement should include the problem the proposal is trying to resolve as well as any proposed solution(s).

## Discussion and Voting
- If there are controversial opinions in relation to the proposed idea, the architecture team may consider starting the voting.
- The voting is considered open when the `voting` label is added to the pull request.
- The voting can be represented as a single/multiple answer survey.
- A valid voting period: 1) must be announced when the voting is started, 2) must be greater that 1 week and 3) must not be changed during the voting.
- The Discussion may continue in the pull request thread.
- Voters cannot change their vote during the voting period.
- Results should be hidden until the voting period ends.

## Results
- Voting results should be added to the corresponding pull request.
- Participants should be mentioned by name.
- When a majority vote exists for a proposal, it does not guarantee that the proposal will be adopted or implemented.

## Eligible voters
All active GitHub users are treated as eligible voters.

## To Do
